Co-Pilot
========

An easy to use censorship simulating access point in a box.

Research on [the needs of digital security trainers](https://www.internews.org/research-publications/training-digital-security-trainers-preliminary-review-methods-needs-and-challe) has demonstrated that one of the leading needs of trainers is a framework for assessing the effectiveness of trainings, as well as a more robust set of tools and resources for evaluating traineesâ€™ uptake during and after trainings. As a part of the overall objective to improve the quality and effectiveness of digital security resources Internews has been exploring innovative and interactive ways to increase the adoption of safer digital behavior while understanding the time constraints of trainers to monitor the progress of participants.

This project is a prototype Training "Co-Pilot:" an easy to use censorship simulating access point in a box. The Co-Pilot will allow a trainer to simulate various censorship environments (Blocking Tor, Throttling psiphon, Blocking IP-Address', Blocking Traffic by keywords) so that trainees are able to safely and actively experience using circumvention tools in a censorship environment. The "Co-Pilot" will allow trainers to gauge trainee understanding when they are still in a positioned to help.
