#### How do I reset the *trainer administrator password* if I forget it?

##### Option 1: Delete the database **UNTESTED**

*NOTE: please let us know if you do this so that we don't have to test it ourselves. :smile:*

The easiest way to reset your trainer administrator password if you forget it is to delete the co-pilot database. If you are using the [default CoPilot configuration](https://github.com/OpenInternet/co-pilot/blob/master/templates/base_config.py#L8) this is located at "/var/lib/copilot/copilot_app.db" This will belete the trainer defaults (AP name, AP password, Trainer Admin password, auto-selection of currently enabled profile) but should not delete any existing profiles.

##### Option 2: Modify the value in the SQL database **COMPLETELY UNTESTED**

**This is not tested because it seems like a lot of work compared to the simplicity of simply deleting the database as shown in option 1. But, it is a thing that you can do.**

If you would like to modify the password directly in the SQL database you can attempt that as well. You will have to run the password through the [bcrypt library](https://flask-bcrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

You can find the properties of the database in the [trainer model](https://github.com/OpenInternet/co-pilot/blob/master/copilot/models/trainer.py#L46-L69). The actual [write for the trainer admin password](https://github.com/OpenInternet/co-pilot/blob/master/copilot/models/trainer.py#L103-L105) shows the usage of bcrypt.
