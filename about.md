Co-Pilot is an easy to use **censorship simulating** access point.

* Co-Pilot allows **trainers** to simulate censorship environments so that participants are able to safely and actively experience using circumvention tools in a censorship environment.

* Co-Pilot is built to allow **developers** to easily add new censorship simulations using its [plugin interface](http://openinternet.github.io/copilot/developer/2016/01/06/plugin-guide.html)

Research on [the needs of digital security trainers](https://www.internews.org/research-publications/training-digital-security-trainers-preliminary-review-methods-needs-and-challe) has demonstrated that one of the leading needs of trainers is a framework for assessing the effectiveness of trainings, as well as a more robust set of tools and resources for evaluating traineesâ€™ uptake during and after trainings. As a part of the overall objective to improve the quality and effectiveness of digital security resources Internews has been exploring innovative and interactive ways to increase the adoption of safer digital behavior while understanding the time constraints of trainers to monitor the progress of participants.

This process resulted in the successful development of the Co-Pilot tool, which has the following features:

- A wireless hotspot that allows trainers to provide a safe environment for participants to explore censorship.
- Easy-to-use interfaces that allows trainers to have fine-grained control of censorship environments.
- Pre-loaded [DNS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZUxoi7YNgs) censorship plugins for [DNS Blocking and Redirection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WyVqHVyN5E).
- A plugin system that allows developers to easily add new censorship and surveillance functionality.
- Support for three [embedded hardware platforms for under $100 USD.](http://openinternet.github.io/copilot/developer/2016/01/08/supported-devices.html)
